1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tor-bridge-setup.git`

`cd tor-bridge-setup`

3. Run the script:

`sudo bash tor-bridge-setup.sh`

4. Follow the prompts to enter a nickname for your Tor bridge.

5. Once the setup is complete, the script will display your Tor bridge fingerprint and bandwidth information, as well as the new SSH port number.

You will be prompted to enter a nickname for your Tor bridge, and the script will guide you through the rest of the setup process.
